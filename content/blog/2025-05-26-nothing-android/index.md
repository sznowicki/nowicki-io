## It’s Nothing

In the last decade I never thought about Android. All I knew was that it’s kinda immature, not well thought through and the ecosystem is in a state of constant chaos with disorganised pieces that sometimes work well together and sometimes not.

Then I noticed some marketing bits from Nothing.tech that looked like there‘s finally some company that takes care of at least some of those issues. And it made me try LineageOS on my wife‘s old Xiaomi phone.

Which was an amazing idea for upcycling this piece of tech. Then while I started using this secondary phone as an actual secondary phone, slowly started getting out of the Apple ecosystem.

First moved from Apple Watch to Garmin Instinct X (that also is much better fit when you spend some of your time on firefighting activities [it has a torch and runs 30 days without charging]).

Then started to fiddle with Jottacloud, Keepass, Linux for Desktop, and eventually once I moved all my family photo library to Google I thought, hey, there‘s nothing really holding me from using Android as my primary system now, except lack of NFC payments on LineageOS, and Gemini is WAY better than Siri. Even on that crappy old phone running LineageOS. 

So I tried Nothing, thank you Nothing for luring me into this lengthy path!

## How it‘s going

Last week Thursday I finally snapped and went to Media Markt. Bought that shiny Nothing Phone 3A for 279€. When I told this to my friend, she said „you mean a payment for a 24 months contract right?“.

Nope, that‘s gross amount.

Honestly thought about Pixel 9A due to it‘s size and some Gemini exclusive but once I realised this thing DOES NOT make HDR photos I immediately finally decided on Nothing 3A.
