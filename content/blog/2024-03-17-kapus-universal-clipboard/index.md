## How can I copy text from iPhone to Android?

That's the question anyone asks themselves when toying with some Android devices while being deeply into Apple ecosystem.

So, I flashed my old Xiaomi 9 Lite with LineageOS for lols (and also to have some experience with Android devices, inb4 someone asks how is it I can only tell, great, for a toy ;P), and before I installed Bitwarden there (which btw provides so much worse experience than Apple native password manager) I was struggling with logging in anywhere.

After some time I tried looking for a simple clipboard-like app that works on both ends and didn't find anything native. Found some web apps but tbh don't trust them.

Also another obvious way would be to use some sort of communicator with disappearing messages but there I also have some trust issues.

So, instead of finishing the Android setup, I started to find a cool domain name for my new web app.

## Kapus.app

Kapus.app (name comes from a Polish word "kapu≈õ", a snitch) is as simple as it can be. You create a "room" with arbitrary name and password.
